This university project aims to develop a benchmark for the ESBMC smart contract checker by creating a large set of vulnerable smart contracts. The smart contracts were written with Solidity, a popular programming language for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The project involved researching common vulnerabilities in smart contracts and implementing them intentionally in the benchmark contracts. The vulnerabilities targeted include reentrancy attacks, integer overflows and underflows, logic flaws, and other common mistakes that can lead to security vulnerabilities.

The benchmark contracts were then tested with ESBMC, a popular software model checker that is capable of verifying the correctness of smart contracts. The results of the tests were analyzed to determine the effectiveness of ESBMC in detecting and preventing vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

The project aims to provide a useful resource for developers and researchers working on smart contract security. By providing a comprehensive set of vulnerable smart contracts, the benchmark can be used to test and compare different smart contract security tools and techniques, ultimately leading to more secure smart contracts and blockchain applications.
